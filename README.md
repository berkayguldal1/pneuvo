## Features

- **User Authentication**: Allows users to create accounts and securely log in using a username and password stored in `login.dll`.
- **Package Simulation**: Users can install and with the `pakage install` command.
- **Python Script Execution**: Execute Python scripts directly from the terminal by typing their name (as long as they exist in the main folder).
- **Customizable Shell**: The default shell is `yash`, but you can extend the functionality by adding more commands.
